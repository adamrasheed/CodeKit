# codekit3
This is the private CodeKit 3 beta repository. It where you download betas and report issues.

### How to Not Suck At Bug Reporting:
1. Make sure you're running the latest beta! Auto-updater won't work in beta.
2. Check existing issues to see if yours already exists.
3. Use the template below and label each section accordingly.

### Bug Reporting Template:
1. Quick, short summary
2. Expected results
3. Actual results
4. *Exact* steps to reproduce
5. A link to download a simplified project or file that shows the issue.
6. Your configuration (any details about your system that you think might be relevant).
7. A comment about my lack of intelligence and/or programming abilities, preferably laced with profanity. This may be copied from HackerNews if necessary.
